# Lake Simcoe Marinas - Map
###### For the second milestone project for 'Interactive Frontend Development' I decided to opt for a single-page app relying heavily on one or more API.


###### For my website, I have focused on the Google Maps API and as the data that I wanted was not available from an external data source, I collated the data and created a data set myself for a smaller number of points on the map. 


###### The aim of the website is to provide recreational boaters with one place where they can plan their trip either on or via Lake Simcoe and the Trent Severn Waterway. Currently if you were going to drive up to Lake Simcoe as a starting point, you would need to visit all the various marina webaites to find out which ones had which facilities and whether they were suitable for your boat so this website negates the need to do that. 


# User Stories
* Greg lives in the city and is hoping to go and see the Barrie Dragonboat festival for the first time in August. He'd like to launch his boat on the South end of Lake Simcoe and spend the early part of the day doing some watersports before heading up to Barrie to watch the race. He needs to find somewhere convenient to launch given the size of his boat and find out what it will cost for him to launch and return.


* Jen and Pete live on the South shores of Lake Simcoe and have been invited to spend a few days at a friends' cottage further North in Georgian Bay. They want to make the most of their boat this Summer and so they're planning to travel up there taking in the new scenery and getting some experience of the locks. They need to find out where they can stop en-route to refuel and grab a bite to eat.


* Darrell is a big fishing enthusiast and has been on day trips to Simcoe before, however, this time he wants to bring a few of his friends and find a marina where he can dock after a day on the lake and has accommodation for them overnight so they can set off early again the next day. 

# Features
There are a number of features that have been deployed in the first version of the site and the potential for more to be added in the future as there really does seem to be a gap and need for this information to be available in one central resource. 


## Existing Features
* User can zoom in and out of the map to see which marinas might be on their route and when they click on a map marker they can easily see the facilities for that marina in a pop-up information window.
* There's an interactive button which when clicked on, filters the markers on the map to show only those marinas that we've classified as 'Full Service' i.e. those that have the broadest range of boating services available and are likely to be the bigger marinas in the area. 
* There are a couple of informative modals that present when user requests; one is to explain the classification of the 'full-service' marina classification and another is to give some useful general information about boating on Lake Simcoe.
