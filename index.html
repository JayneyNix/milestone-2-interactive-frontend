                    Beautiful Lake Simcoe is a popular spot for boaters during the Summer months given it's proximity to Toronto at just over an hours drive. At 30km long, it's also the fourth largest lake in Ontario which can make for some really changeable conditions.
                    If you want to make the most of your day on the lake, it's worthwhile planning a route and checking out the facilities of the local marinas in advance of your trip. We've collated the facilities of the different Lake Simcoe marinas
                    so that you can easily see which ones you might want to use en-route. Happy boating!</p>
